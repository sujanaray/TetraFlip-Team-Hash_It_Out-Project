Fast Relief For Accidents On Road
-> Emergency services at the time of road accidents are crucial for rescuing people in need of critical 
medical attention. Most road accidents lead to deaths when the victims don’t make it to the hospital in 
time or when his requirements aren’t met in a short period. Involving smartphones in the field of 
emergency medical services can boost the quality of service that the victims receive.
-> Finding a good hospital service in an unknown geographical location is also a major challenge. A 
smartphone app to deal with these issues can serve as a big leap in the field of medical service for road 
accidents.
-> Hence, our team is proposing a Web application that provides the user with the list of all hospitals 
present in the nearest location with the help of GPS and any person near the victim can send SMS with 
the location to the Emergency Contacts of the victim registered in the application.
-> This application would hence save a lot of time and effort in finding emergency medical service. This 
might save a lot of lives in need during the time of emergency.
